iOS

iOS (formerly iPhone OS) is a mobile operating system created and developed by Apple Inc. exclusively for its hardware. It is the operating system that presently powers many of the company's mobile devices, including the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. It is the second most popular mobile operating system globally after Android.


ANDROID

Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google, based on the Linux kernel and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Android's user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation, using touch gestures that loosely correspond to real-world actions, such as swiping, tapping and pinching, to manipulate on-screen objects, along with a virtual keyboard for text input. In addition to touchscreen devices, Google has further developed Android TV for televisions, Android Auto for cars, and Android Wear for wrist watches, each with a specialized user interface. Variants of Android are also used on notebooks, game consoles, digital cameras, and other electronics.
Android has the largest installed base of all operating systems (OS) of any kind.[b] Android has been the best selling OS on tablets since 2013, and on smartphones it is dominant by any metric.


MICROSOFT


Microsoft Windows (or simply Windows) is a metafamily of graphical operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft. It consists of several families of operating systems, each of which cater to a certain sector of the computing industry with the OS typically associated with IBM PC compatible architecture. Active Windows families include Windows NT, Windows Embedded and Windows Phone; these may encompass subfamilies, e.g. Windows Embedded Compact (Windows CE) or Windows Server. Defunct Windows families include Windows 9x; Windows 10 Mobile is an active product, unrelated to the defunct family Windows Mobile.


BLACKBERRY

BlackBerry OS is a proprietary mobile operating system developed by BlackBerry Limited for its BlackBerry line of smartphone handheld devices. The operating system provides multitasking and supports specialized input devices that have been adopted by BlackBerry for use in its handhelds, particularly the trackwheel, trackball, and most recently, the trackpad and touchscreen.

Android OS

Android is the world’s most popular mobile operating system platform and it’s my personal favorite.

Pros of Android :

Available on a large range of devices.
Flexibility.Android is the most flexible Operating System of the three we’ve considered.
Google services experience is slick.Apps which tie in with Google’s online services have been integrated well in to Android.
Android has Widgets.Widgets are part web
Cons of Android :

The cons of Android are the other side of the flexibility / configurability coin.

Android is not about Simplicity.
Android does not have the best Reliability.
Android products might appeal to the more technically capable, people prepared to invest in considering their product, who like a particular device form factor and / or who already uses a lot of Google’s online product suite.

iOS

iOS is the Apple Operating System.

Pros of iOS

Simplicity is Apple’s strength.One of Apple’s slogan is ‘It Just Works.’ If this is your first ( smart ) mobile phone or if you find it hard working with computers in general then Apple is more likely to be your sort of device.
Apple offers Consistency across apps and platforms.The experience on Apple devices and in the apps is far more consistent than on other platforms.
It’s hard to fault Apple’s reliability.I don’t think I’ve ever had a call drop out on a call made from an iPhone.
There are a lot of accessories available More accessories can make your iPhone more useful to you and more integrated with your life.


Cons of iOS

Device range is limited.Unless you want an older iPhone 4S instead of a newer one, range of Apple iPhones is not as broad as those available to people prepared to consider the other two Operating Systems.
Apple devices have apps but no tiles or Widgets.The range of apps available in the iTunes store is great. But they’re just apps.
Apple products are not that personalisable.
Price. iPhones are expensive.You’ll be lucky to get away with a contract less than $50 per month for any kind of iPhone.
Apple products can appeal to people new to smart mobile phones, who love the Apple brand and have experience of it and who know how useful apps can be.


Windows Phone 8

The Windows Phone 8 mobile Operating System falls somewhere between Android and Apple. It’s not nearly as popular, especially now. However, the platform is gaining momentum. It has some features you won’t find in either Android or iOS. Windows 8 is a credible product and, in the opinion of Whatphone, you could do a lot worse than consider it.

Pros of Windows Phone 8

Simplicity.Windows Phone 8 is clear, simple, slick, looks modern and is holistically considered.
Stability.Like Apple’s iOS, I’ve never had a  dropped call or a crashed app.
Personalisable. The homepage can be configured with Tiles. You can change the color of every screen component in settings.
Innovative software features.Windows Phone 8 has a few new features which neither Android vs iOS have managed to embed. A kids area can be configured in the settings of Windows Phone 8. Swipe left from the homepage ( once set up ) and you’ll see an area where children can play safely.
Range of devices is neither a Pro or a Con at this stage for Windows 8 devices. There are only a small number of products in the Australian market but it’s growing all the time.

The Windows Phone 8 range is already larger than Apple’s portfolio.

Cons of Windows Phone 8

Apps. There is not nearly the range of apps available for Windows Phone 8.Of the dozen or so applications I install as default on iOS or Android products I’m testing, less than half were available in the Windows 8 store.
Windows Phone 8 might appeal to business people, those who put family first and everyone who wants to keep it simple.


BLACKBERRY

The veteran BlackBerry has seen its fair share of ups and downs in the market. Geared towards the corporate world, BlackBerry has adapted new strategies matching close rivals such as Google’s Android. Here is a shortlist of what makes BlackBerry a perfect and not-so-perfect choice among corporate professionals.

BlackBerry Pros

Push Email Technology.  Proud owners of BlackBerry devices are always up to date when it comes to messaging.  BlackBerry easily integrates push email technology in a breeze, allowing you to instantly receive messages as soon as they start showing up in your inbox. With BlackBerry’s push email service, you can easily receive and send messages in just a matter of seconds.

Hardware.  BlackBerry’s elegant keyboard still remains the number one choice for many of its customers. The elegant QWERTY keyboard allows faster typing and accuracy that is not normally found in many of its competitors. BlackBerry also is known for being rugged yet sexy, making it durable and resistant to many forms “abuse.”

Data Management.  The lifeblood that makes BlackBerry phones a stable choice for many corporate officials would be its handling of data compression. BlackBerry phones are capable enough for compressing data down to half the size, saving you the cost of expensive bandwidth.

Battery Life.  Amongst other competitors, BlackBerry seemingly has the best battery management providing users optimal power consumption in just a single full charge.


BlackBerry Cons

Applications.  RIM has managed to follow in the footsteps of Apple by introducing their own BlackBerry App World. With much hype, the app store lacked decent amount of applications and it failed to attract developers with its poor interfaced leading to its demise.

Slow Web Browser. Unlike its competitor, BlackBerry has the most sluggish response time when it comes to browsing the Internet. Although BlackBerry features data compression, it still can’t keep pace in loading Web resources like wallpapers and pictures.

Business-oriented.  Achieving its success by bridging the gap to the corporate world, BlackBerry failed to realize how important the average user can be.  BlackBerry is looked upon as a corporate tool rather than an average device for the everyday person.

ANDROID VS IOS VS WINDOWS 10 MOBILE: APPS - STOCK AND DOWNLOADABLE

How the operating systems looks and handles is important, but it arguably pales in comparison to the real difference maker between all these three: the apps.

Apps and app stores can make or break an operating system. You can have a gorgeous look, slick feel and, as Microsoft has found with successive Windows mobile platforms, still fail if your app situation is not up to par.

iOS, Android and Windows 10 Mobile each have their own storefront - iOS has the App Store, Android has Google Play and Windows 10 Mobile has the Windows Store.
A few years ago, Apple dominated the app space. It had the best apps, both in terms of functionality and design. It also had the 'triple-A' games, and overall developer support was top notch. If a new app or app update was coming, it would most likely hit iOS first.

The story has changed somewhat in recent years, but not entirely. Android now has pretty much all of the big-name apps, and new ones are typically launched more or less simultaneously with iOS (or not long after). Some even make their debut on Android, owing to Google's more relaxed approval process.

Many triple-A games are also seeing an equal release footing between iOS and Android, though iOS still has more of an advantage here than with regular apps. That can largely be put down to the persistent issue of Android hardware and software fragmentation, which poses more of a challenge for game developers due to the added performance demands.

There's still definitely an iOS bias here. Spotify and Instagram, for example, both tend to trial new features with their iOS apps before bringing them to Android later.

And then there's Windows 10 Mobile. Ah, Windows 10 Mobile. It's certainly safe to say that in the app landscape, Microsoft's baby currently lags a distant third. Make no mistake, there are plenty of apps on Windows 10 Mobile and the number of big players offering something for the platform is growing. Spotify, Dropbox, Facebook, Twitter, Vine and Instagram are all present and correct, and that covers a lot of the apps people use on a daily basis. But such apps frequently lag behind the top two platforms when it comes to receiving updates, and they often lack fairly fundamental features. Developers seem to release an app, mention it now supports Windows 10 Mobile and then turn their attention back to iOS and Android.

Windows 10 Mobile offers hope in that it's built on the same core as Windows 10 itself. The main advantage of this is that it's possible to create universal apps that works in both the desktop and mobile environments. The company also put some work into making it easier to port apps from Android and iOS to Windows 10 Mobile, but the main initiative is those Universal Apps.
That's the idea, anyway. In practice, the Windows 10 app ecosystem has gotten off to a slightly shaky start. Developers have been slow on the uptake (perhaps burned by previous Windows and Windows Phone systems), and those Windows 10 Universal Apps that have been made haven't always been of the best quality.

But it's still early days for Windows 10, and Microsoft seems determined to stay the course. This is supposed to be "the last version of Windows", after all. From now on, Windows will be a service that's constantly and incrementally improved, and there's a clear path to ensuring a well-supported mobile ecosystem within that.

All we need now is a few more decent apps and some compelling Windows 10 Mobile hardware (a Surface Phone, maybe?), and iOS and Android might have to think about glancing back for a second.

Built-in apps also make a big difference to how the operating system functions. Many Android OEMs bake in their own apps, but Google's suite of core apps - Gmail, Calendar, Photos, Maps - are all fantastic. They're well integrated, slick looking and work every time. You can also grab them all, apart from Photos, if you're running iOS.

Apple's default apps for iOS are spartan in design terms, but they're a good choice if you're heavily tied into Apple's ecosystem. Notes will sync back to your Mac, you can beam Map directions to your phone and tap out an iMessage (free messaging between iOS and OS X devices) on your desktop. Unlike on Android, you can't set which apps are your default, which also means you're stuck with the Apple-provided phone and messages apps for handling calls and SMS messages.
We do prefer Google's design language over Apple's though. It's just got a bit more about it. It's fresher, sleeker and not quite so bare. There's a balance to it, where iOS feels like all of the core functionality has been stacked up in the margins.

Windows 10 Mobile's built-in apps are generally a big improvement over the threadbare offerings of Windows Phone 8.1, particularly in terms of the Edge web browser and Outlook email app. But there's a glaring problem when comparing it to the other two platforms: both Android and iOS have access to most of Microsoft's key apps. What's more, those apps are of a really high quality, often outshining the equivalent experience on Windows. We're thinking particularly of the latest Outlook app, but there's a case to be made for Office too.



Apps
When it comes to smartphone satisfaction, ultimately it's all about the apps. All three major mobile operating systems can cover your basic productivity needs, but there are big differences when it comes to the number and variety of apps available.

Android: In terms of sheer scope, the Android app store – dubbed the Google Play store – rivals the iOS App Store, with more than 1 million apps available. That includes everything a business user needs for taking notes, balancing a budget or viewing and editing documents. There are some small discrepancies; apps sometimes debut on iOS first, and iOS retains some notable exclusives. For the most part, however, the overall quality and availability of apps on Android and iOS is about equal.

iOS:It's hard to top Apple's App Store when it comes to app support and availability. It can match almost every offering and Android and Windows Phone, and some popular business software, such as the Kashoo accounting app, are exclusive to iOS.

Windows Phone: The Windows Phone Store is perhaps best known for having a much smaller selection of apps than competing platforms – about 100,000, compared to selections of more than 1 million on Android and iOS. That doesn't mean there isn't a Windows phone app to cover all the needs of business users. If you're looking for a good calendar app, or a popular productivity app such as Evernote, you're likely to find it. The Windows Phone Store is also growing fast. But for now, if you're loyal to a particular mobile app or service, make sure it's available on Windows Phone before committing to the platform.

Features
Baked into each mobile OS are unique features that will give business users a boost.

Android: Android offers Google Now, an intelligent personal assistant that can help business users stay on track and never miss a call or meeting. The service works by monitoring your activity within the Google ecosystem and pushing relevant notifications to you as they're detected. In practice, the service can notify you of traffic delays, weather, upcoming appointments and much more.

iOS: The iWork for iOS apps are fully integrated with Apple's desktop iWork applications, letting users view and edit documents seamlessly on multiple devices. The latest iteration of iOS also adds features such as AirDrop, which lets users share files with a single tap, as well as a revamped email app with the ability to add auto-sorting mailboxes and view PDF annotations.

Windows Phone: Windows Phone is the only mobile platform with Live Tiles, which update in real time to display relevant information right on your home screen, ensuring you never miss a message or meeting. The platform's biggest draw for business users, however, is its full integration with Microsoft Office.

Security
Security is a top concern for business users who handle sensitive information, such as private client data, on their mobile device.

Android: It's easy to side-load an unapproved app on an Android phone by downloading and installing the application from a source other than the Google Play store. Google is also more relaxed about which apps it allows to appear in its app store, and the fragmented Android landscape makes it trickier to patch vulnerabilities. In most cases, however, your files should be secure if you stick to apps from trusted sources only.

iOS: Apple's iOS is a highly secure mobile operating system. It's virtually impossible to install apps from unofficial sources -- at least without a concerted effort– and all apps are reviewed and approved before they become available to download in the App store.

Windows Phone: On the security front, the Windows Phone platform is comparable to iOS. All apps are reviewed and approved by Microsoft, and unlike on Android there's no need to consider dedicated anti-virus and anti-malware software.

Phone selection
Each of the three major platforms runs only on specific smartphone models.

iOS: It’s easy to pick an iOS device, because the operating system is found only on the iPhone. Currently, Apple sells just three version of the iPhone: the flagship iPhone 5S, the fastest and most feature-packed model; the midrange iPhone 5C, which comes in a variety of colorful cases; and the lower-end iPhone 4S. Power users can opt for the 5S, which packs a fingerprint scanner for added security in addition to powerful hardware; meanwhile, the 4S is still speedy enough to satisfy a business user on a budget.

Android: What the Android platform offers that competitors do not is a huge selection of unique phones. This is a big plus for power users who wish to select a smartphone with a very specific feature set, but it can be tricky to navigate through dozens of mediocre devices. Consider sticking to top-tier phones such as Samsung's Galaxy Note 3, Motorola's Moto X or LG's G2.

Windows Phone: Windows Phone comes on just a handful of smartphone models. The most popular are the phones in the colorful Nokia line from Nokia, but several other models are available from manufacturers, including HTC and Samsung. Business users who want a well-rounded phone can consider the Lumia 925, while those who want a big screen can check out the Lumia 1520.

Conclusion:
Ultimately, Android, iOS and Windows Phone have a lot in common, and each provides a solid platform for business users to run the apps they need. But each also has one-of-a-kind, productivity-boosting features. Windows Phone boasts a user-friendly interface and handy features such as Live Tiles. Android is the most customizable, making it a good fit for power users. Meanwhile, iOS offers a simple but powerful interface that's backed up by the best overall selection of apps.
